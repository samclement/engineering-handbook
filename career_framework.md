# Software Engineering Career Framework

This framework aligns roles across the Individual Contributor (IC) and Management tracks using the following framing from the career-team-reporting Excalidraw:
- Junior → Mid ICs emphasise SDLC execution and craft.
- Staff → Principal ICs add strong technical leadership and cross-team influence.
- Managers carry people/operations responsibilities that dovetail into broader leadership from EM → HoSE → SHoSE.

Each role below lists scope, expected competence, and the crossover into leadership for that level.

- **Leadership Crossover:** Leads small initiatives; mentors; champions engineering standards.

### Staff Software Engineer
- **Primary Focus:** Technical leadership and cross‑team influence; still hands‑on.
- **Scope:** A product area or critical platform; 2–3 quarter horizon; high ambiguity.
- **Competence:**
  - **Architecture:** Sets technical direction; chooses long‑term trade‑offs.

  - **Change Leadership:** Drives cross‑org migrations and standards adoption.
  - **External:** Represents engineering in cross‑functional/exec forums.
- **Leadership Crossover:** Mentors Staff/Senior; builds leadership bench; aligns leaders on principles and outcomes.

## Management Track

### Engineering Manager (EM)
- **Primary Focus:** Outcomes through people; delivery, quality, growth, and health.
- **Scope:** One team; 1–2 quarter horizon; medium ambiguity.
- **Competence:**
  - **People:** Hiring, onboarding, feedback, performance, growth plans.
  - **Delivery:** Backlog health, predictability, cross‑functional collaboration.
  - **Operations:** On‑call/process ownership; escalations; risk management.
  - **Technical:** Staff‑level technical literacy; reviews for direction/quality.
- **Leadership Crossover:** Facilitates team‑level leadership; aligns with partners; cultivates culture and standards.

### Head of Software Engineering (HoSE)
- **Primary Focus:** Multi‑team leadership; strategy, resourcing, and execution at group level.
- **Scope:** 2–5 teams/one portfolio; annual horizon; high ambiguity.
- **Competence:**
  - **Org Design:** Team topology, ownership boundaries, succession planning.
  - **Strategy/Planning:** Roadmap shaping, investment trade‑offs, metrics.
  - **Execution:** Leads cross‑team programs; resolves systemic blockers.
  - **Technical:** Principal‑level judgement; governs architecture via leaders.
- **Leadership Crossover:** Dovetails into org leadership—sets culture, principles, and operating model with peers.

### Senior Head of Software Engineering (SHoSE)
- **Primary Focus:** Org and company‑level leadership across portfolios.
- **Scope:** Several portfolios; multi‑year horizon; very high ambiguity.
- **Competence:**
  - **Strategy/Vision:** Long‑range bets; portfolio shaping; value and risk framing.

  - **Cross‑Company:** Aligns with product, design, data, security, finance.
  - **Technical Governance:** Distinguished‑level guidance through councils/principles.
- **Leadership Crossover:** Executive‑level leadership; steers culture and outcomes at scale.

## SDLC vs Leadership Emphasis
- **Junior → Mid IC (GSE → SSE):** Majority focus on SDLC execution (delivery, quality, operability) and craft. Leadership is local (mentoring, raising standards).
- **Staff → Principal IC:** Leadership becomes primary lever: strategy, architecture, cross‑team execution, and stakeholder alignment.
- **Managers (EM → HoSE → SHoSE):** People/operations responsibilities at EM broaden into leadership that mirrors IC leadership at higher altitude: strategy, portfolios, and organisational systems.

## Leveling Signals Matrix (Summary)
- **Scope:**
  - GSE/ASE: tasks → small stories; single component.
  - SE/SSE: component/service ownership; team scope.
  - Staff: product area/platform; multi‑team scope.
  - Principal: portfolio/org; cross‑org scope.
- **Time Horizon:** days → weeks → quarters → year+ → multi‑year.
- **Ambiguity:** low → medium → high → very high.
- **Leadership:** none → local → team → multi‑team/org → company.
- **Technical Judgement:** follows → chooses within patterns → defines patterns → sets direction → sets principles/governance.

## Expectations By Review
For calibration and growth planning, assess against role expectations in three lenses:
- **Outcomes:** Business/customer impact at expected scope and horizon.
- **Execution:** Predictability, quality, reliability, and risk management.
- **Leadership:** Influence, alignment, mentoring, and raising the bar.
